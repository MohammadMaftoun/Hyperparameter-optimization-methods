Hyperparameter optimization techniques for machine learning projects

# Overview

This README provides an introduction and overview of three popular hyperparameter optimization techniques: Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. These methods are commonly used in machine learning to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given model.


Hyperparameter optimization is the process of systematically searching for the best hyperparameters for a given model and dataset.
