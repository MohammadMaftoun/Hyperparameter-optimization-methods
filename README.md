Hyperparameter optimization techniques for machine learning projects

# Overview

This README introduces and overviews three popular hyperparameter optimization techniques: Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. These methods are commonly used in machine learning to optimize the hyperparameters of a model.

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is an essential step in training machine learning models. Hyperparameters are configuration settings not learned from the data but set before the training process. Examples include learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of hidden layers in a neural network. The performance of a machine learning model is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters, and finding the optimal values can significantly improve the model's accuracy and generalization. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of systematically searching for the best hyperparameters for a shared model and dataset.
Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as random search, grid search, and Bayesian optimization play pivotal roles in optimizing machine learning model performance. Random search efficiently explores hyperparameter combinations by random sampling, providing good results, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. Grid search exhaustively evaluates all specified combinations, ensuring thorough exploration of the search space but can be computationally intensive. Bayesian optimization, leveraging probabilistic models, intelligently selects hyperparameter configurations, often converging to optimal solutions more efficiently by incorporating previous evaluations.
